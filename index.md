## About us
We are are a new research group at the [Helmholtz Centre Geesthacht](https://www.hzg.de/index.php.en) near Hamburg, within the [Institute of Coastal Research](https://www.hzg.de/institutes_platforms/coastal_research/index.php.en). Our group is part of the [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) initiative.

## Our research
Our ultimate aim is to understand and predict the complex dynamics of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, ocean, land and ice.

### Physical Models vs. Data Models 
On the one hand, numerical simulators based on known physics simulators handle complex systems well, but struggle with data assimilation, parameter tuning and uncertainty quantification.

Conversely, machine learning techniques can absorb and process large datasets, but ignore physics and generalizes poorly to new scenarios.

## Machine Learning Seminar
We organize a weekly seminar on Machine Learning. We discuss papers on ML, often (but not always) with a connection to Earth science, climate and weather.

The seminar also allows members of the Hamburg machine learning community to connect and present their ongoing work. We meet in person at HZG, but we also welcome remote online participants and stream the meeting live on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyXAYFO3h-tBIEbPEqMnNKw). To get updates about each meeting, please [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mlhzg/join). 

## Online code
We publish our code on [github](https://github.com/m-dml), and are committed to software sharing as a principle of open and reproducible science.

## Open positions
If you're interested in a position as a Master's student, PhD or Postdoc, please write to [David](david.greenberg@hzg.de) with a CV and statement of interest.
