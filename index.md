## Research Group
Our group is part of the [Institute of Coastal Systems](https://hereon.de/institutes/coastal_systems_analysis_modeling/index.php.en) on the [Hereon](https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en) research campus near Hamburg. We are part of the [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) initiative.

In [our research](research.html) we investigate the Earth system at the boundary between physics-based and machine learning approaches, to gain insights unavailable to either approach alone.

We also organize a weekly journal club on machine learning at Hereon, aimed at the Earth science and deep learning communities of the Helmholtz Institutes and the Hamburg area. Please [write us](mailto:david.greenberg@hereon.de) if you're interested in joining in person or online.

## Software
We publish our code on [github](https://github.com/m-dml), and are committed to software sharing as a principle of open and reproducible science.

## Open Positions
We have an opening for a Masters student interested in carrying out research for a thesis project--please write to [David](mailto:david.greenberg@hereon.de) with a CV and statement of interest. Candidates should have curiosity, persistence and a solid foundation in machine learning, math, physics, algorithms or the geosciences.
