## Research Group
Our group is part of the [Institute of Coastal Systems](https://hereon.de/institutes/coastal_systems_analysis_modeling/index.php.en) on the [Hereon](https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en) research campus near Hamburg. We are part of the [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) initiative.

In [our research](research.html) we investigate the Earth system at the boundary between physics-based and machine learning approaches, to gain insights unavailable to either approach alone.

We also organize a biweekly [seminar](seminar.html) on machine learning at Hereon, aimed at the scientific communities of the Helmholtz Institutes and the Hamburg area.

## Software
We publish our code on [github](https://github.com/m-dml), and are committed to software sharing as a principle of open and reproducible science.

## Open Positions
* We are currently hiring 2 postdocs to work on Earth system foundation models. These postdocs will work to train neural networks for simulation, understanding and prediction of the oceans and atmosphere. This project is distinguished from previous work in its emphasis on long-term (seasonal-to-decadal) accuracy and stability, and by its ambitious of encompassing the full system from the oceans to the stratosphere. The application deadline is **June 23**. For more info and to apply, see our [job posting](https://hereon.de/career/vacancies/025898/index.php.en).

* We have an opening for a Masters student interested in carrying out research for a thesis project--please write to [David](mailto:david.greenberg@hereon.de) with a CV and statement of interest. Candidates should have curiosity, persistence and a solid foundation in machine learning, math, physics, algorithms or the geosciences.
