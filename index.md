## About Us
We are are a new research group headed at the [Helmholtz Centre Geesthacht](https://www.hzg.de/index.php.en) near Hamburg, within the [Institute of Coastal Research](https://www.hzg.de/institutes_platforms/coastal_research/index.php.en). The group, led by David Greenberg, is part of the [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) initiative.

In [our research](research.html) we investigate the Earth system at the boundary between physics- and data-driven approaches, to gain insights unavailable to either approach alone.

We also organize a weekly [seminar](seminar.html) on machine learning at HZG, aimed at the scientific communities of the Helmholtz Institutes and the Hamburg area.

## Online Code
We publish our code on [github](https://github.com/m-dml), and are committed to software sharing as a principle of open and reproducible science.

## Open Positions
If you're interested in a position as a Master's student, PhD or Postdoc, please write to [David](mailto:david.greenberg@hzg.de) with a CV and statement of interest.
