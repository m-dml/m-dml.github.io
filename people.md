      <strong>David Greenberg</strong>
      <br/>
      Group Leader
      <br/><br/>
      David leads the M-DML group. Before moving to Earth science, he did a Postdoc in ML and a PhD in computational neuroscience.
      His primary research goal is applying machine learning to address critical computational problems in Earth science, such as predictability, parameter tuning, parameterization, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation.
