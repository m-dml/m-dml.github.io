## Seminar
We organize a weekly seminar on machine learning. We discuss papers on ML, often (but not always) with connections to Earth science, climate and weather and materials science.

The seminar also allows members of the Hamburg machine learning community to connect and present their ongoing work. We meet in person at HZG, but we also welcome remote online participants and stream the meeting live on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyXAYFO3h-tBIEbPEqMnNKw).

To get updates about each meeting or suggest a topic, please [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mlhzg/join).

## Future Topics
### 3. "MetNet, Convolutional-Recurrent Nets, and the Self-Attention Principle" 07.04.20
The next ML@HZG seminar will be this upcoming Tuesday 7.4 at 3pm. We'll cover Google Research's recent work on weather prediction: "MetNet: A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Forecasting," SÃ¸nderby et al., 2020, arXiv. [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12140.pdf)[blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/a-neural-weather-model-for-eight-hour.html)

To understand the ML tools that went into this work, we'll briefly review some concepts from earlier works:
* The convolutional LSTM, which combines convolutional and recurrent neural nets into a single architecutre, as introduced by Xingjian et al. in 2015. [pdf](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5955-convolutional-lstm-network-a-machine-learning-approach-for-precipitation-nowcasting.pdf)
* Self-attention and the Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), provide a new alternative to convolutional and recurrent nets. MetNet uses a specialized variant called Axial Attention (Ho et al., 2019, [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12180.pdf)). We'll turn to this [blog post](http://www.peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) by Peter Bloem for helpful illustrations.

With these concepts in mind, we'll examine how MetNet combines them, and consider their results from the perspectives of both ML and weather prediction.

## Past Topics
### 2. "Don't Fear the Sphere" 31.03.20
We cover "[Spherical CNNs on Unstructured Grids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02039.pdf)," Jiang et al. 2019, ICLR. We also survey other ML approaches to spherical data (more links in the description on YouTube).
With 5 minute presentations by Julianna Carvalho, Tobias Finn and Lennart Marien.

### 1. "Hidden Fluid Mechanics" 24.03.20
We discuss the paper "[Hidden fluid mechanics: Learning velocity and pressure fields from flow visualizations](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6481/1026)," Raissi et al. 2020, Science, and the more technical study from the same group, "[Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125)," Raissi et al., 2019, J. Computational Physics.
Tobias Weigel from DKRZ explains the ML support team that forms part of the local Helmholtz AI unit.
