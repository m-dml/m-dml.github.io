### 1. "Hidden Fluid Mechanics" 24.03.20
We discuss the paper "[Hidden fluid mechanics: Learning velocity and pressure fields from flow visualizations](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6481/1026)," Raissi et al. 2020, Science, and the more technical study from the same group, "[Physics Informed Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125)," Raissi et al., 2019, J. Computational Physics.
Tobias Weigel from DKRZ explains the ML support team that forms part of the local Helmholtz AI unit.
