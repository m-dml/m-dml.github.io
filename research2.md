## Research
Our ultimate aim is to understand and predict the complex dynamics of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, ocean, land and ice.

### Physical Models
Numerical simulations based on known physics simulators handle complex systems well, but struggle with data assimilation, parameter tuning and uncertainty quantification.

### Machine Learning
Conversely, machine learning techniques can absorb and process large datasets, but typically ignore physics and generalize poorly to new scenarios.

### Model-driven Machine Learning
We develop hybrid methods that combine the advantages of deep learning and physical modeling in a Bayesian framework. Examples of this hybrid approach include:
* Neural networks that solve differential equations.
* Algorithms that learn to infer model parameters using simulation results as training data.
* Machine learning models that respect physical laws.
* Flexible function approximators to fill gaps in our physical knowledge.
* Normalizing Flows, VAEs and GANs that model uncertainty in temperature, rainfall, fire and flooding.
