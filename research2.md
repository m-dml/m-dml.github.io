## Research
Our ultimate aim is to understand and predict the complex dynamics of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, ocean, land and ice.

### Physical Models
Numerical simulations based on known physics simulators handle complex systems well, but struggle with data assimilation, parameter tuning and uncertainty quantification.

### Machine Learning
Conversely, machine learning techniques can absorb and process large datasets, but typically ignore physics and generalize poorly to new scenarios.

We develop hybrid methods that combine the advantages of deep learning and physical modeling in a Bayesian framework. Examples of this hybrid approach include:
* Neural networks that solve differential equations.
* Algorithms that learn to infer model parameters using simulation results as training data.
* Machine learning models that respect physical laws.
* Flexible function approximators to fill gaps in our physical knowledge.
* Normalizing Flows, VAEs and GANs that model uncertainty in temperature, rainfall, fire and flooding.
